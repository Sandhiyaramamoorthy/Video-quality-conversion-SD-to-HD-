# Video-quality-conversion-SD-to-HD-
Develop a prototype of a video conversion process that can upscale SD resolution (640 x 480px) videos to HD resolution (1280 x 720px) using traditional interpolation techniques. The tool should efficiently resize the video frames while maintaining the overall quality. It should preserve the original audio and merge it with the upscaled video.
